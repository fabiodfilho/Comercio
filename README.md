My code referring to the phase 1 & 2 of project of Unifacisa's java course, which contains 6 features of the Java language. 

This code is a Java console program that simulates a basic product management system in a store. It allows the user to perform various product-related operations such as listing, registering, adding stock, removing products, and making sales.

The code is entirely in the Java language. Version 1.0 of the system works with the storage of products in ArrayLists, using a while loop as a repetition structure, and switch and case as a conditional structure.

The parts of version 1.0 of the code are being updated.
